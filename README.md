A Flutter App project to help farmers sell their goods directly to the consumers.

## Getting Started

## Preparation

### Prerequisites

- Uses [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) and [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases). **Make sure they are installed before cloning**.

- A good IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

### Cloning

Use the following command to clone:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ANI-Capstone/ani.git ani-capstone
# Cloning into 'ani-capstone'...
# ...
```

### Dependencies Installation

To install dependencies on a fresh clone, navigate to the folder and run the following:

```bash
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter pub outdated
$ flutter pub upgrade
```

Depending on your hardware and internet speed, it may take a while. You may safely ignore any deprecated and vulnerability warnings.

## Running the Flutter App for Local Development

If the prerequisites were done correctly, running the command below should start the app:

- Create an AVD in Android Studio or connect your android phone to use as your External Device.
- Navigate the run button in your IDE and click it. You can click F5 if you are using VSCode to run the app.

Wait for the processes to finish. Depending on your hardware, it may take a while.
